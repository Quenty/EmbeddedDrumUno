\begin{center} \textbf{Customer	Requirements} \end{center}
	Play	a	basic	beat.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Each drum stick will be able to perform three different patterns that are at least 40 seconds in length.
	\item Pass	requirement: The drum kit will be able to strike one of the drums in order to perform a basic beat.
	\item A demo-video will also be required.
\end{enumerate}
	
\begin{center} \textbf{Engineering Requirements} \end{center}
\textbf{Hardware:} we will be using a pre-assembled drum kit that is composed of a single drum, two drum sticks,an H-bridge, an actuator, and the drum itself.\\\\
\begin{center} \textbf{Architecture} \end{center}
The system uses three main components for its architecture
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Communication\\ Within the system, a single	controller	regulates the beats output by the drum. In order to achieve this, the system must be able to accept an input and process it to obtain the correct output.
		
		\item Musical Input Translator\\ The system must be able to accept music data and convert it to an input that the system can use. This is done through a conversion program and custom compiler.
		\item Drumstick	Controller\\
		The	drumstick	controller is	a component	that inputs commands	to	hit	and	retract	the	drumstick . The controller must use these commands to output signals to the correct drumstick motor.
	\end{enumerate}
\begin{center} \textbf{Design} \end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Communication\\The compiler translates drumLang files and uses the output to	control	the	motors	to	operate	the	drumsticks	and	strike	the	
	drums.
	\item Musical Input Translator\\ The system accepts music data and converts it to an input that the system can use. This is done through a conversion program and compiler as mentioned before.
	\item Drumstick	Controller\\
	The	drumstick	controller is	a component	that inputs commands	to	hit	and	retract	the	drumstick. The controller must use these commands to output signals to the correct drumstick motor.
\end{enumerate}
